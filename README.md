***Kings Corner***

This game is built on Java and uses ASCCI art instead of a GUI.

***Compile and Run***

Compile:  'make main'
Run:      'make run' or 'java KingsCorner'

***Misc.***

I have implemented an extra command '^'.  Type this for the computer to finish the round for you! 
This is for debugging and is hidden per say.
